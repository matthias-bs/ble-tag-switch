# Objective

> Your goal is to implement a new feature or fix a bug.

# Workflow

Perform the necessary steps in the following order:

## Access issue details

- If an issue is given to be implemented, access the issue tracker using the MCP interface and read the issue description as well as all comments to get the full context about the issue.
- If you are asked to implement an issue step only, look for hints left by a prior agent instance in the issue comments. Implement this step only.
- Check if we are working on the `main` branch. Warn if this is not the case and offer to switch to `main` branch. If the user wants to switch, switch to the `main` branch.

## Access learnings

- Read the `LEARNINGS.md` file in the project root to get important learnings from prior implementations rounds.

## Implementation

- Perform your implementation tasks, following the best practices.
- For new features or solved bugs, add tests or test cases matching the structure of the existings tests. Be thorough, but do not cover every detail with a test. Make a reasonable decision what is necessary for being tested.

## Validation

- Run checks via the VSCode `Checks` task.
- Fix all errors and warnings reported by the checks. Repeat until all checks pass.
- Run tests via the VSCode `Test` tasks.
- Fix any failing tests including all warnings. Repeat until all tests pass.

## Adapt documentation

- Scan the documentation for inconsistencies and necessary adaptions triggered by this issue's changes.
- Adapt the documentation accordingly to reflect the changes made.

# Hints

- Complain if the current setup is not sufficient for performing an implementation. In this case, make a proposal on how to enhance the situation.
- Do **not** commit the changes yet. They will be reviewed in a manual process and then committed by a later agent instance. Focus on the implementation and leave the committing to a later stage.
